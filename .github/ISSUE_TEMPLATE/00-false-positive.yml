        Thank you for reporting a false positive(*)!

        Please read this carefully. Cutting corners will delay the resolution of your issue!

        We know this can be frustrating and confusing for webmasters, developers, and website owners. Please be patient; one of our team members will look into your issue as soon as possible.

        To help us understand the problem, please provide clear and accurate information without unnecessary details. Keep your responses short and to the point. Our team knows what information they need, and they will ask for more if necessary.
        
        ### Important Notes:
        - **Title**: Please only enter your domain name or IP.
        - **One Issue per Domain**: Only report one domain per issue. If you have multiple issues, please use the comments section to refer to them instead of repeating everything.
        - **Basic Information Only**: When filling in the text boxes, do not include protocols like `https`. This applies to:
          - **Domain**
          - **URIs**
          - **IP** addresses and ranges (use CIDR notation, e.g., `192.0.2.0` or `192.0.2.0/24`)
        - **Comments**: Add any comments in the "Please explain why you believe this is a false positive" section only.
        - **Discovery**: "How did you discover this false positive?" is optional but appreciated.
        - **Review Requests**: If you have asked for a review from other sources, just mention who it was, without a long explanation. We will ask for more details if needed. Please use the "Relevant links" to link to any resources

        If you have any questions or need assistance, please ask in our [Discussions](https://github.com/Phishing-Database/dev-center/discussions) section.
